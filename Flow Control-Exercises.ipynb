    "Here's a simple real-world application from the ever-growing field of Bioinformatics. Genetic information is stored in DNA, which is a sequence of 4 bases (the nucleotides, conventionally indicated by the uppercase letters A, C, T, G). Thus a part of a gene might look like the string [\"GATTACA\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gattaca). During [translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(biology)), molecular machinery converts the genetic sequence to a string of aminoacids constituting a protein (proteins are the building blocks of our bodies). In particular, DNA is read as a sequence of three-letter long \"words\" (the *codons*), each of which identifies an aminoacid. Aminoacids are also written as uppercase alphabet letters. So a sequence like \"ATACAACCTGGTTCA\" would be segmented as \"(ATA)(CAA)(CCT)(GGT)(TCA)\" and translated to \"IQPGS\", according to the [standard genetic code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_codon_table) (see also the dictionary below). In reality, these sequences are a few thousand characters long, hence the need for Bioinformaticians to crunch them. Happily, if we discard all the chemistry, this is just straightforward string processing. \n",
